## Instructions

This repository includes code developed as part of the dissertation "Sentiment Analysis and Audiobook Generation for Icelandic Narrative Text and Conversations", written as part of requirements for MSc Machine Learning at UCL.

The code is divided into two. The first folder, LLM_eval, includes code to evaluate LLMs for sentiment analysis. The second folder, tts, includes code to generate speech snippets as part of TTS evaluation. 

Both folders include seperate README files to better describe the projects.
